+ Project summary: This project demonstrates 3 specific algorithms from the _Machine Learning Fairness_ literature on the COMPAS (Correctional Offender Management Profiling for Alternative Sanctions) dataset from propublica. We implement, evaluate and compare the following algorithms:  Learning fair representations (LFR), Maximizing accuracy under fairness constraints (C-SVM and C-LR), Maximizing fairness under accuracy constraints (gamma and Fine-gamma).
